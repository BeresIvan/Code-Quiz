Project Title:
Code Quiz
 
The Project:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
* WHEN I click the start button a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question.
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and score
